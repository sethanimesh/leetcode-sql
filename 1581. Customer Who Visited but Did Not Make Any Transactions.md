# 1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Visits` and `Transactions`.

- The `Visits` table contains information about customer visits, including `visit_id` and `customer_id`.
- The `Transactions` table contains information about the transactions made by customers during their visits, including `transaction_id` and `visit_id`.

Write a SQL query to find the `customer_id` of customers who visited but did not make any transactions. Also, count the number of visits where the customer did not make any transactions.

### Table: Visits

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| visit_id     | int     |
| customer_id  | int     |

### Table: Transactions

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |

## Solution

To get the required information, we will perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `Visits` and `Transactions` tables using the `visit_id` as the common key. Then, we will filter for rows where the `transaction_id` is `NULL`, meaning no transaction was made during the visit.

```sql
SELECT v.customer_id, count(*) AS 'count_no_trans'
FROM Visits as v
LEFT JOIN Transactions as t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id 
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT v.customer_id, count(*) AS 'count_no_trans'`**: Selects the `customer_id` from the `Visits` table and counts the number of visits where no transaction was made, aliasing the result as `count_no_trans`.
- **`FROM Visits as v`**: Specifies the `Visits` table and assigns it an alias `v`.
- **`LEFT JOIN Transactions as t`**: Joins the `Visits` table with the `Transactions` table using an `INNER JOIN` on the `visit_id` column.
- **`ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id`**: Specifies the join condition that matches the `visit_id` in the `Visits` table with the `visit_id` in the `Transactions` table.
- **`WHERE transaction_id IS NULL`**: Filters for rows where the `transaction_id` is `NULL`, meaning no transaction was made during the visit.
- **`GROUP BY v.customer_id`**: Groups the results by `customer_id`.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the tables:

#### Visits

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 101         |
| 2        | 102         |
| 3        | 101         |

#### Transactions

| transaction_id | visit_id |
|----------------|----------|
| 1              | 1        |

### Sample Output

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 101         | 1              |
| 102         | 1              |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Visits` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of customers who did not make transactions.
