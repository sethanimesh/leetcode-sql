# 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## Table Schema

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_id  | int  |
| low_fats    | enum |
| recyclable  | enum |

**Primary Key:** `product_id`

### Column Details

- **`product_id`**: An integer representing the unique identifier for each product.
- **`low_fats`**: An ENUM with possible values:
  - `'Y'`: Indicates the product is low fat.
  - `'N'`: Indicates the product is not low fat.
- **`recyclable`**: An ENUM with possible values:
  - `'Y'`: Indicates the product is recyclable.
  - `'N'`: Indicates the product is not recyclable.

## Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to retrieve the `product_id`s of all products that are **both** low fat and recyclable.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the `products` table has the following data:

| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | N          |
| 4          | Y        | Y          |

### Sample Output

```
1
4
```

## Solution

To find the products that are both low fat and recyclable, you need to filter the records where both `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns have the value `'Y'`. This can be achieved using the `WHERE` clause with an `AND` condition.

```sql
SELECT product_id 
FROM products 
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT product_id`**: Selects the `product_id` column from the table.
- **`FROM products`**: Specifies the table to query.
- **`WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'`**: Filters the records to include only those where both `low_fats` and `recyclable` are `'Y'`.

This query returns all `product_id`s that satisfy both conditions, effectively identifying products that are both low fat and recyclable.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `products` table. The database needs to scan each record to check the conditions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of products that meet both criteria. This space is used to store the resulting `product_id`s.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the `products` table has an index on the `low_fats` and `recyclable` columns to optimize query performance, especially for large datasets.
- If there are a large number of matching records, consider implementing pagination to manage the output effectively.
