# 1378. Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Employees` and `EmployeeUNI`.

- The `Employees` table contains employee information, including their `id` and `name`.
- The `EmployeeUNI` table contains the unique identifiers for the employees.

Write a SQL query to replace each employee's `id` with their corresponding `unique_id` from the `EmployeeUNI` table.

### Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

### Table: EmployeeUNI

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| unique_id   | int     |
| id          | int     |

### Problem Details

You need to return a table with the employee `unique_id` from the `EmployeeUNI` table along with the `name` of the employee from the `Employees` table.

## Solution

We will perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `Employees` and `EmployeeUNI` tables based on the common `id` column to retrieve the `unique_id` and employee `name`.

```sql
SELECT u.unique_id, e.name 
FROM Employees AS e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI AS u
ON u.id = e.id;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT u.unique_id, e.name`**: Selects the `unique_id` from `EmployeeUNI` and the `name` from `Employees`.
- **`FROM Employees AS e`**: Specifies the `Employees` table as the base table and assigns it an alias `e`.
- **`LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI AS u`**: Performs a left join with `EmployeeUNI` (alias `u`) to include all rows from the `Employees` table.
- **`ON u.id = e.id`**: Joins the tables on the common `id` column to match records between the two tables.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the tables:

#### Employees

| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 1  | John   |
| 2  | Alice  |
| 3  | Bob    |

#### EmployeeUNI

| unique_id | id |
|-----------|----|
| 101       | 1  |
| 102       | 2  |
| 103       | 3  |

### Sample Output

| unique_id | name  |
|-----------|-------|
| 101       | John  |
| 102       | Alice |
| 103       | Bob   |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employees` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of matching records from the `EmployeeUNI` table.
