# 197. Rising Temperature

## Problem Statement

You are given a table `Weather` that contains daily weather records.

Write a SQL query to find all dates' `id` where the temperature is higher than the temperature of the previous day.

### Table: Weather

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| recordDate  | date    |
| temperature | int     |

### Problem Details

Return the `id` of the days where the temperature is higher than the previous day's temperature.

## Solution

To get the required information, we will perform a `JOIN` operation on the `Weather` table by joining it with itself. The join condition checks if the difference between `recordDate` of two rows is exactly one day. Then, we filter the rows where the temperature on the current day is higher than the temperature on the previous day.

```sql
SELECT y.id 
FROM Weather x
JOIN Weather y
ON DATEDIFF(x.recordDate, y.recordDate) = -1
WHERE y.temperature > x.temperature;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT y.id`**: Selects the `id` from the second table alias `y`, which refers to the current day.
- **`FROM Weather x`**: Specifies the `Weather` table and assigns it an alias `x`, representing the previous day.
- **`JOIN Weather y`**: Joins the `Weather` table with itself, using alias `y` to represent the current day.
- **`ON DATEDIFF(x.recordDate, y.recordDate) = -1`**: Specifies the join condition to match rows where the date difference between `x` and `y` is one day (yesterday and today).
- **`WHERE y.temperature > x.temperature`**: Filters the rows where the temperature on the current day (`y.temperature`) is greater than the temperature on the previous day (`x.temperature`).

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the `Weather` table:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2021-07-01 | 30          |
| 2  | 2021-07-02 | 35          |
| 3  | 2021-07-03 | 28          |
| 4  | 2021-07-04 | 32          |

### Sample Output

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Weather` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of matching records that satisfy the conditions.
