# 1280. Students and Examinations

## Problem Statement

You are given three tables: `Students`, `Subjects`, and `Examinations`.

- The `Students` table contains information about students, including their `student_id` and `student_name`.
- The `Subjects` table contains the `subject_name`.
- The `Examinations` table contains the `student_id` of the students who attended the examination, and the `subject_name` of the subject they attended.

Write a SQL query to return the student ID, student name, subject name, and the number of examinations the student has attended for each subject. If a student has not attended any examination for a subject, the number of attended examinations should be 0.

### Table: Students

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |

### Table: Subjects

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| subject_name | varchar |

### Table: Examinations

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |

## Solution

To get the required information, we will:
- Perform a `CROSS JOIN` between the `Students` and `Subjects` tables to generate a combination of every student and every subject.
- Use a `LEFT JOIN` to join this combination with the `Examinations` table to count the number of attended exams for each student-subject pair.

```sql
SELECT s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s2.subject_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS 'attended_exams'
FROM Students AS s1
CROSS JOIN Subjects AS s2
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON s1.student_id = e.student_id AND s2.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s2.subject_name
ORDER BY s1.student_id, s2.subject_name;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s2.subject_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS 'attended_exams'`**: Selects the student ID, student name, subject name, and the number of attended exams (count of `e.student_id`).
- **`FROM Students AS s1`**: Specifies the `Students` table and assigns it an alias `s1`.
- **`CROSS JOIN Subjects AS s2`**: Performs a `CROSS JOIN` with the `Subjects` table to generate all combinations of students and subjects.
- **`LEFT JOIN Examinations e`**: Joins this result with the `Examinations` table to count the attended exams. This ensures that students who have not attended any exam will still be included, with a count of 0.
- **`ON s1.student_id = e.student_id AND s2.subject_name = e.subject_name`**: Joins the tables on matching `student_id` and `subject_name`.
- **`GROUP BY s1.student_id, s1.student_name, s2.subject_name`**: Groups the results by student and subject to calculate the number of attended exams.
- **`ORDER BY s1.student_id, s2.subject_name`**: Orders the result by student ID and subject name.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the tables:

#### Students

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |

#### Subjects

| subject_name |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| English      |

#### Examinations

| student_id | subject_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |
| 2          | English      |

### Sample Output

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | English      | 0              |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 2              |
| 2          | Bob          | English      | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 0              |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of students and m is the number of subjects.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of records returned.
