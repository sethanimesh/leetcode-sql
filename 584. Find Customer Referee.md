# 584. Find Customer Referee

## Table Schema

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

**Primary Key:** `id`

### Column Details

- **`id`**: An integer representing the unique identifier for each customer.
- **`name`**: A varchar representing the name of the customer.
- **`referee_id`**: An integer representing the `id` of the customer who referred them. It can also be `null` if the customer was not referred by anyone.

## Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of all customers who **are not referred** by the customer with `id = 2`.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the `Customer` table has the following data:

| id | name  | referee_id |
|----|-------|------------|
| 1  | John  | 2          |
| 2  | Jane  | null       |
| 3  | Jack  | 1          |
| 4  | Sarah | 3          |
| 5  | Mike  | null       |

### Sample Output

```
Jane
Jack
Sarah
Mike
```

## Solution

To find the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with `id = 2`, we need to select those where:
- The `referee_id` is not equal to `2`, or
- The `referee_id` is `null` (indicating no referee).

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Customer 
WHERE referee_id <> '2' OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT name`**: Selects the `name` column from the table.
- **`FROM Customer`**: Specifies the `Customer` table to query.
- **`WHERE referee_id != '2' OR referee_id IS NULL`**: Filters the records to include only those where the `referee_id` is not equal to `2` or is `null`.

This query will return the names of all customers who were either not referred or referred by someone other than the customer with `id = 2`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Customer` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of customers who meet the condition.

## Additional Notes

- If needed, make sure the `referee_id` column is indexed to improve query performance, especially for large datasets.
