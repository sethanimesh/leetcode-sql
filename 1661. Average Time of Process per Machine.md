# 1661. Average Time of Process per Machine

## Problem Statement

You are given a table `Activity` that records the start and end times of processes executed by machines.

Write a SQL query to calculate the average processing time for each machine. The processing time for each process is defined as the difference between the start and end timestamps. The average processing time should be rounded to three decimal places.

### Table: Activity

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| machine_id    | int     |
| process_id    | int     |
| activity_type | enum    |
| timestamp     | int     |

### Problem Details

- The `activity_type` column is an ENUM that can take either `'start'` or `'end'` values.
- The query should return the `machine_id` and the average processing time for each machine.

## Solution

To get the required information, we will perform a `JOIN` operation on the `Activity` table by joining it with itself. The join condition will match the `machine_id` and `process_id` for both the start and end times. We will then calculate the difference between the timestamps and find the average.

```sql
SELECT a1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a1
JOIN Activity a2
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
WHERE a1.activity_type = 'start' 
AND a2.activity_type = 'end'
AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id
GROUP BY a1.machine_id;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT a1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time`**: Selects the machine ID and calculates the average processing time for each machine by taking the difference between the `end` and `start` timestamps and rounding it to three decimal places.
- **`FROM Activity a1`**: Specifies the `Activity` table and assigns it an alias `a1` to represent the start time.
- **`JOIN Activity a2`**: Joins the `Activity` table with itself using alias `a2` to represent the end time.
- **`ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id`**: Joins the tables on `machine_id` to match the machine for both start and end activities.
- **`WHERE a1.activity_type = 'start' AND a2.activity_type = 'end' AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id`**: Filters the records to ensure we are matching the start and end activities for the same process.
- **`GROUP BY a1.machine_id`**: Groups the results by `machine_id` to calculate the average processing time for each machine.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the `Activity` table:

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1          | 101        | start         | 161000    |
| 1          | 101        | end           | 161050    |
| 2          | 102        | start         | 161100    |
| 2          | 102        | end           | 161120    |

### Sample Output

| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 1          | 50.000          |
| 2          | 20.000          |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Activity` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of machines.
