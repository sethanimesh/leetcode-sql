# 1075. Project Employees I

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Project` and `Employee`.

### Table: Project

| Column Name  | Type  |
|--------------|-------|
| project_id   | int   |
| employee_id  | int   |

- `project_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table indicates that the `employee_id` is assigned to a project with `project_id`.

### Table: Employee

| Column Name       | Type  |
|-------------------|-------|
| employee_id       | int   |
| experience_years  | int   |

- `employee_id` is the primary key for this table.
- Each row in this table contains the `employee_id` and the years of experience of the employee.

Write an SQL query to find the **average years of experience** of the employees for each project, rounded to **2 decimal places**.

## Solution

To solve this problem:
- Perform a `JOIN` between the `Project` and `Employee` tables based on `employee_id`.
- Use `AVG()` to calculate the average number of experience years for each `project_id`.
- Use `ROUND()` to round the average to 2 decimal places.
- Group the results by `project_id` to get the average per project.

```sql
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM project p
JOIN employee e 
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;
