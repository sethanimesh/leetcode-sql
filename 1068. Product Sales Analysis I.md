# 1068. Product Sales Analysis I

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables: `Sales` and `Product`.

- The `Sales` table contains information about the sales of products, including `product_id`, `year`, and `price`.
- The `Product` table contains product information, including `product_id` and `product_name`.

Write a SQL query to return the product name, year, and price for each sale by joining the two tables on the `product_id`.

### Table: Sales

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| year        | int     |
| price       | decimal |

### Table: Product

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |

## Solution

To get the required information, we will perform an `INNER JOIN` between the `Sales` and `Product` tables using the `product_id` as the common key.

```sql
SELECT p.product_name, s.year, s.price
FROM Sales as s
JOIN Product as p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT p.product_name, s.year, s.price`**: Selects the product name, year, and price from the `Product` and `Sales` tables.
- **`FROM Sales as s`**: Specifies the `Sales` table and assigns it an alias `s`.
- **`JOIN Product as p`**: Joins the `Sales` table with the `Product` table using an `INNER JOIN` on the `product_id` column.
- **`ON s.product_id = p.product_id`**: Specifies the join condition that matches the `product_id` in the `Sales` table with the `product_id` in the `Product` table.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the tables:

#### Sales

| product_id | year | price |
|------------|------|-------|
| 1          | 2020 | 100   |
| 2          | 2021 | 200   |

#### Product

| product_id | product_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Product A    |
| 2          | Product B    |

### Sample Output

| product_name | year | price |
|--------------|------|-------|
| Product A    | 2020 | 100   |
| Product B    | 2021 | 200   |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Sales` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of matching records in the join operation.
