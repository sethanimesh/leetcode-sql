## Problem: 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

### Problem Description

You are given a `Teacher` table that contains the following columns:

- `teacher_id` (int): ID of the teacher.
- `subject_id` (int): ID of the subject taught by the teacher.

Each row represents a teacher teaching a particular subject. Some teachers might teach multiple subjects, and there might be duplicate entries for the same subject taught by a teacher.

### Objective

Write an SQL query to find the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id;
```

### Explanation

1. **SELECT teacher_id**: Retrieve the teacher's ID.
2. **COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt**: Count the distinct `subject_id` for each `teacher_id` to avoid counting the same subject multiple times.
3. **FROM Teacher**: Specify that we are querying from the `Teacher` table.
4. **GROUP BY teacher_id**: Group the results by `teacher_id` to ensure the count is calculated per teacher.

### Example

Given the following data in the `Teacher` table:

| teacher_id | subject_id |
|------------|------------|
| 1          | 2          |
| 1          | 2          |
| 1          | 3          |
| 2          | 3          |
| 2          | 4          |

The query will return:

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 2   |

### How the Query Works

- The `DISTINCT` ensures that each subject is counted only once per teacher.
- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the result set based on each `teacher_id`, so that we can count subjects per teacher.
