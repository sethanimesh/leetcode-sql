# 595. Big Countries

## Table Schema

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |

**Primary Key:** `name`

### Column Details

- **`name`**: A varchar representing the name of the country.
- **`continent`**: A varchar representing the continent to which the country belongs.
- **`area`**: An integer representing the total area of the country in square kilometers.
- **`population`**: An integer representing the population of the country.
- **`gdp`**: A bigint representing the Gross Domestic Product of the country.

## Problem Statement

A country is considered big if:

- It has an area of at least 3 million (i.e., 3,000,000 km²), or
- It has a population of at least 25 million (i.e., 25,000,000 people).

Write a SQL query to find the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the big countries.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the `World` table has the following data:

| name       | continent | area   | population | gdp      |
|------------|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| Australia  | Oceania   | 7692024| 25000000   | 12000000 |
| Belgium    | Europe    | 30528  | 11589623   | 530000   |
| Brazil     | South America | 8515767 | 212559417 | 24000000|
| Canada     | North America | 9984670 | 38005238 | 17000000|
| China      | Asia      | 9596961 | 1402112000| 143000000|

### Sample Output

| name       | population | area    |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Australia  | 25000000   | 7692024 |
| Brazil     | 212559417  | 8515767 |
| Canada     | 38005238   | 9984670 |
| China      | 1402112000 | 9596961 |

## Solution

To find the big countries, we need to select countries that either have an area greater than or equal to 3,000,000 km², or a population greater than or equal to 25,000,000.

```sql
SELECT name, population, area 
FROM world 
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT name, population, area`**: Selects the `name`, `population`, and `area` columns from the table.
- **`FROM world`**: Specifies the `World` table to query.
- **`WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000`**: Filters the records to include only those where the area is at least 3 million km² or the population is at least 25 million people.

This query will return the names, populations, and areas of all countries that meet the criteria for being "big."

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `World` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of big countries that meet the criteria.
