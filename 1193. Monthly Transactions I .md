# SQL Query - Monthly Transactions Summary

## Problem Statement:
We need to generate a summary of monthly transactions grouped by country, including:
1. **Total Transactions**: The count of all transactions.
2. **Approved Transactions**: The count of transactions with the state 'approved'.
3. **Total Transaction Amount**: The sum of amounts for all transactions.
4. **Approved Transaction Amount**: The sum of amounts for approved transactions.

## SQL Solution:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, 
    country, 
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 END) AS approved_count, 
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m'), country;
```

### Explanation:

- **month**: The formatted month (year and month) from the transaction date.
- **country**: The country where the transaction occurred.
- **COUNT(*)**: Returns the total number of transactions.
- **COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 END)**: Counts only the approved transactions.
- **SUM(amount)**: Sums up the total transaction amount.
- **SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)**: Sums the amounts of only the approved transactions.

### Assumptions:
- The table `Transactions` contains at least the following columns:
  - `trans_date`: The date of the transaction.
  - `country`: The country where the transaction was made.
  - `state`: The transaction's status, such as 'approved' or others.
  - `amount`: The monetary value of the transaction.

### Output:
This query returns a summary of transactions for each month and country with:
1. **Total transaction count**.
2. **Approved transaction count**.
3. **Total transaction amount**.
4. **Approved transaction amount**.
