# 1934. Confirmation Rate

## Problem Statement

You are given two tables `Signups` and `Confirmations`:

- The `Signups` table contains the `user_id` of users who signed up.
- The `Confirmations` table contains the `user_id` of users who either confirmed their sign-up or did not. It also has an `action` column, which indicates whether the action taken by the user was a "confirmed" action or not.

Your task is to write a SQL query that returns the `user_id` and the `confirmation_rate` for each user. The `confirmation_rate` is the ratio of confirmed actions to the total number of actions for that user, rounded to 2 decimal places. If a user has no actions in the `Confirmations` table, their confirmation rate should be 0.

### Table: Signups

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |

### Table: Confirmations

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| user_id     | int     |
| action      | varchar |

## Solution

To get the required information, we will:
- Perform a `LEFT JOIN` between the `Signups` and `Confirmations` tables, joining them by `user_id`.
- Use `AVG()` with a `CASE` statement to calculate the confirmation rate, treating the "confirmed" action as `1` and any other action as `0`.
- Use `COALESCE()` to handle cases where users have no records in the `Confirmations` table, ensuring their confirmation rate is `0`.
- Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places using `ROUND()`.

```sql
SELECT s.user_id, 
       COALESCE(ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2), 0) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c 
USING (user_id)
GROUP BY s.user_id;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT s.user_id`**: Selects the `user_id` from the `Signups` table.
- **`COALESCE(ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2), 0)`**: Calculates the confirmation rate for each user by averaging the results of the `CASE` statement, where confirmed actions are treated as `1` and others as `0`. If the user has no records in `Confirmations`, the `COALESCE()` function ensures a rate of `0`.
- **`FROM Signups s`**: Specifies the `Signups` table with alias `s`.
- **`LEFT JOIN Confirmations c USING (user_id)`**: Performs a `LEFT JOIN` on the `user_id` field to bring in data from the `Confirmations` table.
- **`GROUP BY s.user_id`**: Groups the results by `user_id` to calculate the confirmation rate for each user.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the `Signups` and `Confirmations` tables:

#### Signups

| user_id |
|---------|
| 1       |
| 2       |
| 3       |

#### Confirmations

| user_id | action    |
|---------|-----------|
| 1       | confirmed |
| 1       | canceled  |
| 2       | confirmed |

### Sample Output

| user_id | confirmation_rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| 1       | 0.50              |
| 2       | 1.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Signups` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of records returned.
