# SQL Query - Query Quality and Poor Query Percentage

## Problem Statement:
We need to calculate two key metrics for a set of queries:
1. **Quality**: The average rating-to-position ratio, representing the overall quality of the query.
2. **Poor Query Percentage**: The percentage of queries with a rating below 3, indicating poor performance.

## SQL Solution:

```sql
SELECT query_name, 
       ROUND(AVG(rating/position), 2) AS quality,
       ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM queries 
WHERE query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY query_name;
```

### Explanation:

- **query_name**: This column represents the name of the query.
- **AVG(rating/position)**: Computes the average quality score for each query by dividing the rating by the position.
- **SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)**: Calculates the percentage of poor-performing queries, where the rating is less than 3.
- **ROUND()**: Rounds off the results to two decimal places for better readability.

### Assumptions:
- The table `queries` contains at least the following columns:
  - `query_name`: Name of the query (must not be null).
  - `rating`: Rating of the query (numerical).
  - `position`: The position of the query (numerical).

### Output:
This query returns a list of queries with:
1. **quality**: The average quality score of the query (rating divided by position).
2. **poor_query_percentage**: The percentage of queries with a rating below 3.
