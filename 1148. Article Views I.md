# 1148. Article Views I

## Table Schema

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |

### Column Details

- **`article_id`**: An integer representing the unique identifier for an article.
- **`author_id`**: An integer representing the identifier of the author who wrote the article.
- **`viewer_id`**: An integer representing the identifier of the viewer who viewed the article.
- **`view_date`**: A date representing when the article was viewed.

## Problem Statement

Write a SQL query to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

## Solution

To find authors who have viewed their own articles, we need to select records where `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id` (i.e., the author viewed their own article). We will then return distinct `author_id`s and sort them in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(author_id) AS id 
FROM Views 
WHERE author_id = viewer_id 
ORDER BY author_id;
```

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the `Views` table has the following data:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 1         | 3         | 2021-01-01 |
| 2          | 2         | 2         | 2021-01-02 |
| 3          | 3         | 1         | 2021-01-03 |
| 4          | 3         | 3         | 2021-01-04 |

### Sample Output

| id  |
|-----|
| 2   |
| 3   |

## Explanation

- The author with `author_id = 2` viewed their own article on `2021-01-02`.
- The author with `author_id = 3` viewed their own article on `2021-01-04`.

Therefore, the result will include these authors.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Views` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of distinct authors who viewed their own articles.
