# 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

## Problem Statement

You are given a table `Employee` that contains employee information, including their `id`, `name`, and `managerId`. Write a SQL query to find the names of managers who have at least 5 direct reports.

### Table: Employee

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

### Problem Details

Each `managerId` in the `Employee` table refers to the `id` of another employee who is the manager. Your task is to find the names of managers who have 5 or more employees directly reporting to them.

## Solution

To get the required information, we will:
- Perform an `INNER JOIN` on the `Employee` table with itself, matching `id` with `managerId` to find employees reporting to managers.
- Use `GROUP BY` on `managerId` to count the number of direct reports for each manager.
- Filter the result using `HAVING` to find only those managers with at least 5 direct reports.

```sql
SELECT e1.name
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2
ON e1.id = e2.managerId
GROUP BY e2.managerId
HAVING COUNT(*) > 4;
```

## Explanation

- **`SELECT e1.name`**: Selects the name of the manager.
- **`FROM Employee e1`**: Specifies the `Employee` table with alias `e1` to represent managers.
- **`JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.id = e2.managerId`**: Joins the `Employee` table with itself, matching `e1.id` (the manager's ID) with `e2.managerId` (the employee's manager ID).
- **`GROUP BY e2.managerId`**: Groups the result by `managerId` to count the number of employees reporting to each manager.
- **`HAVING COUNT(*) > 4`**: Filters the results to include only managers with more than 4 direct reports.

## Example

### Sample Input

Assume the following data for the `Employee` table:

| id  | name    | managerId |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| 1   | John    | NULL      |
| 2   | Alice   | 1         |
| 3   | Bob     | 1         |
| 4   | Charlie | 1         |
| 5   | Dave    | 1         |
| 6   | Eve     | 1         |

### Sample Output

| name  |
|-------|
| John  |

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of managers who meet the condition.
